## Features

- **Performance**: Our solution ensures excellent performance, achieving green scores in core web vitals.
- **Dynamic Pages**: Say goodbye to editing code for creating new pages. With our CMS integration, you can effortlessly create new pages and customize their content.
- **Page Composition**: Easily compose pages by dragging and dropping pre-built components. Each component can be populated with content specified in the CMS.
- **Live Preview**: As you work with content in Sanity Studio, you can instantly preview the page with the current changes, ensuring a seamless editing experience.
- **Visual Editing**: No more searching for documents and fields in the CMS to edit specific elements. Our visual editing feature allows you to click on an element outline and automatically open the required document for easy editing.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG) with Dynamic Elements**: Leverage the latest Next.js feature to combine static and dynamic rendering on a single page. Deliver content to users with maximum performance.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration**: Our web hook connects Sanity Headless CMS with Vercel projects, triggering page regeneration upon content changes. This ensures minimal delay between content updates and production deployment.
